# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-2-C950 WGUPS Routing Program
This project delivers a parcel routing program for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS), designed to meet specific delivery requirements efficiently. The program employs a custom-built hash table and self-adjusting algorithms to optimize routing for multiple trucks, ensuring all 40 packages are delivered on time within a 140-mile total distance constraint.

# Key Features
# Self-Adjusting Algorithm:
Uses a named algorithm, such as a greedy or nearest neighbor algorithm, to prioritize and assign package delivery routes, balancing delivery deadlines and distance limitations.

#Custom Hash Table:
Developed without external libraries, the hash table organizes package details (e.g., address, delivery time, weight) for fast retrieval and lookup.
# User Interface:
Allows real-time status tracking of any package, with screenshots provided to verify accurate package status updates at various times.
# Components
# Algorithm Justification and Design:
Includes a breakdown of the algorithm's logic, pseudocode, and its space-time complexity. Evaluates the algorithmâ€™s efficiency and scalability for potential future expansions.
# Delivery and Routing Simulation: 
The main Python program simulates real-world delivery constraints, such as address updates and load capacities.
# Interface for Tracking: 
An intuitive interface allows users to monitor delivery status, track total mileage, and get updates on individual packages.
# Test Plan: 
Functional tests validate package insertion, lookup, and routing success.
